ESPN SCRAPPING 

In this project I scrape a IPL data on a website named "ESPN".

How it works :

We provide a link of a match page of ESPN website.
It gives two outputs:
1st - Highest wicket taker name,no. of wickets taken by him and his economy in that match.
2nd - highest sixer name no. of sixes and his strike rate in that match.
